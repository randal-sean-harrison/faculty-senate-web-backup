<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>The Notre Dame Faculty Senate is an assembly elected to represent the faculty as a whole in the formulation of policy on matters regarding the welfare of the faculty and student life. The Senate aims to empower faculty to exercise a collective independent voice in the governance of the University.</p>
<h2>Our Work</h2>
<p>According to the provisions established in the <a href="https://facultyhandbook.nd.edu/" target="_blank">Academic Articles</a> and the Faculty Senate Bylaws, Faculty Senators are elected for three-year terms, during which they relay the opinions and concerns of colleagues from their department or unit to the Senate. Likewise, Senators inform their constituents about the Senate agenda and engage their colleagues in discussion to identify new issues of importance for discussion by the Senate.</p>
<p>The Senate also takes up proposals &mdash; created internally or received externally &mdash; that require faculty consideration. The Senate may produce non-binding resolutions and reports which it submits to the Academic Council, the Advisory Council on Academic and Student Life, the Graduate Council, the Campus Life Council, or other relevant committees and/or University officers.</p>
