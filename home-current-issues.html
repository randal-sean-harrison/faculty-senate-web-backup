<h2>Current Issues</h2>
<p>Our <a href="/committees/" target="_blank">Standing Committees</a> investigate and pursue continuing issues relevant to faculty and student life at Notre Dame each academic year.</p>
<details><summary>Administrative Affairs Committee</summary>
<p>The Faculty Affairs Committee presented to the Academic Council the final proposal for wording for a Committee on Committees. The wording was accepted and added to the Academic Articles. The Committee on Committees will be established for the 2022-2023 Academic Year and will help ensure faculty input is distributed in University governance. The Committee is also discussing issues including improving staff wages, support for an increasingly diverse student body, and promoting connections with community leaders.</p></details>

<details><summary>Academic Affairs Committee</summary>

<p>The Academic Affairs has worked to have the Academic Council clarify the meaning of &quot;temporary suspension&quot; of an academic program. The Academic Council added language to the Academic Articles clarifying that the temporary suspension of a degree program is not considered a major modification to the degree program...will not exceed two years...and requires the appropriate Dean write a letter to the executive committee of the Academic Council prior to each year of the suspension explaining the reasons for continuing suspension. This empowers faculty by better defining &ldquo;temporary,&rdquo; and requiring the Dean to articulate a rationale and criteria justifying suspension.</p></details>
